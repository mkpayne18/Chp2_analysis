# Chp2_analysis: predict out-of-sample stream attractiveness to hatchery strays across SEAK

### Purpose

----

To use the model developed in Chp1_analysis to predict the average number of stray hatchery-origin chum salmon in additional streams in SEAK for which there is no observed data. I predicted stream attractiveness out-of-sample for streams 1) in 2008-2019, 2) 2020-2021, and 3) given 3 new hypothetical release site scenarios <br>

See "docs/Methods_Model_logChp2.docx" for more details

Also, "old_stuff" folder is a previous version of the Chp2_analysis folder. I've
since reorganized this to create the current Chp2_analysis folder and therefore
the "old_stuff" folder should be rendered obsolete, but I held onto it just in
case

Update March 2023: The data folder is no longer on Github since I am downgrading to a free (and public) Github account and hatchery data is proprietary. Please contact me to access data to run code
